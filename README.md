**_:warning: Warning:_**
Do not use `mock-prices.json` [URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redstone-finance/redstone-mock-prices/main/mock-prices.json) to test fast-changing prices. Possibly Github has an advanced cache for serving files and changes in the repo could not be visible on the node's side. |

It is better to start a simple server and serve data on a local machine. Tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) could be helpful in exposing the local server to the external world.
